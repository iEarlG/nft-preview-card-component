## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Vite.js](https://vitejs.dev/)
- [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/) - For styles

### What I learned

I learned alot from this challenge, as always it's really challenging for me is the responsiveness of the web I really need more practice on that, but I realized that not all styles need to put on the media queries.
